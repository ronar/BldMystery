# Mystery of Blade
`Mystery of Blade` is a project containing decompiled source code of `Severance: Blade of Darkness` game.
# Target version
The target is classic (not Steam) version released at 2001 with patch v1.01 installed.
# Status
### Fully recovered binaries
- `Bladex.dll`
- `Netblade/Netblade.dll`
- `netgame.dll`
- `Raster.dll`
### Partially recovered binaries
- `Blade.exe`
- `rOpenGL.dll`
# Method
- Create Visual Studio project with native `assembly` code of `Blade.exe`.
- Choose function/method which source code we want to reconstruct.
    - Provide `C++` implementation of this function/method.
    - Remove `assembly` implementation of this function (using `process_asm.py` script).
- Go to the next function/method.

So we have consistent project at each stage.
